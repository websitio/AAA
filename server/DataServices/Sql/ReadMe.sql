/* 
The sql here in this folder is just used as a developer aid
to easily and quickly create a few records with relational
data to have something to render from GET requests
to the endpoints / controllers that, at this point in dev time,
have the first implemention / interation of a repo interface.
NB user names cannot be inserted via sql as the hash and salt
requires "middleware". As these current'ly need to be created
via "manual" registration, I might explore the possbility of wscript.
